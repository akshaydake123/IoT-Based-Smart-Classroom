# IoT-Based-Smart-Classroom-Android-App

Background and Description of Problem 
#
The management of classrooms, halls, offices, and public spaces and the efficient use of these resources in any organization are challenging problems. With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT), the management of these resources can be automated. Methods to automatically record activities and monitor resource usage inside classrooms in real-time are usually intricate.

This project focuses on achieving college automation along with smart classrooms integration. In today’s world automation is gaining a lot of importance and IoT is becoming more popular day by day, this project focuses on smart class rooms in college by installing small INTERNET connected devices in each classroom. This system is expected to help automate classroom electronics such as tube light, fan, sound system, projector etc.

We tend to set up a system which can operate the basic functions of taking the attendance of a class with the help of a mobile application which also helps for Availability of classroom.
In this project, we aimed to design classroom that enables real-time, automatic feedback on the quality of a lecture and the level of satisfaction of the auditorium with the lecture and the lecturer. Such real-time feedback will allow the lecturer to adapt the lecture during the presentation to achieve the maximum impact as well as to modify the future lectures based on the learnings from the past cases.

# Main Research Objectives

•	Tracking availability of classrooms and therefore avoiding potential clashes of Lectures.\
•	Energy Conservation in Classrooms.\
•	Maintaining user comfort in Classrooms.\
•	Feedback from the users about Class comfort level and then use it to improve the experience.

# The Methodology
We divide the system into three parts:
1. Amazon Alexa Echo-dot voice service, Messenger based Chatbot Application, Android Application, Server Connectivity to Devices.
2. Server client programming, Data Acquisition and Storage.
3. Sensors location, calibration and interfacing.

# Features Implemented :	
1.Monitoring Status of AC and Projector using sensors.
2.Checking the availability of Classroom.
3.Real time Feedback from user.

# Technology Used :
Android Development, Node.js, Amazon Alexa Echo -dot, Heroku-Server, MongoDB.
